The Bible tribute page is a freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Track Project, where I show some information about the bible.

## Built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3

Check the project in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/genesisgabiola/full/BqXZaW/).

## Future Improvements:
- [ ] Maybe change the background image to a more elegant image.
- [ ] Make the page more responsive for the smaller devices.
- [ ] Display a verse tooltip when hover to a passage verse link.
